TODO: Describe your blog here and provide a link to the live version on GitHub Pages.

A short summary of the project:

I made a jekyll website containing information about Dragon Ball Z. It contains a character page based on the homepage of the last assignment. From this page you can pick: Goku, Vegeta, Broly, Raditz, Nappa and Bardock. All these characters have their own html page. Moreover, the github folder contains 2 stylesheets: 1 for the homepage, and 1 that works for all different characters. I also added a mp3 file so you can play the DBZ intro tune for fun. I hope you enjoy the site as much as I do :)

Additional information:
- In both CSS files I've used more than 5 CSS properties and different types of CSS selectors. I gave the different characters an #id.
- I've used the bootstrap component: a badge on the homepage (Approved by King Vegeta).
Also, I've used the bootstrap grid model in order to implement the layout of the saga appearances for every character. 
- My stylesheets use color and fond-weight as variables. Moreover, I nested my selectors in both SCSS files and I've implemented inheritance by making 3 different types of characters: A Good Character, A Conflicted Character, and an Evil character.
