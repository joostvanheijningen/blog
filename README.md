# Dragon Ball Z the blog
TODO: Describe your blog here and provide a link to the live version on GitHub Pages.

First things first:
I failed to remove the files from the official web-apps-blog-repository and therefore I made this new one. Sorry for that :)

A short summary of the project:

I made a jekyll website containing information about Dragon Ball Z. It contains a homepage, an about page, a character page based on the homepage of the last assignment and a blog page. The website is responsive to screensize and hovers. On all of the pages you can navigate yourself with tha navbar. On the about page you may learn about the website. From the character page you can pick a character and learn more about them. and from the blog page you may learn about different episodes for every blog post.

The github folder contains: 
- 2 includes: navbar and footer
- 2 layouts: 1 default and for the blogposts
- assets folder: with scss, bootstrap and a manga font
- 6 character htmls (from earlier project)
- 4 page htmls: index, about, characters, blog
- 6 blogposts in markdown
- And a configuration file .yml


I hope you enjoy the site as much as I do :)
